# 3D Solar System

A simple interactive 3D model of our solar system built with web technologies.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS:** For styling the page elements.
*   **JavaScript:** For the core logic and interactivity.
*   **Three.js:** A JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D computer graphics in a web browser.

## Milestones

Here's a breakdown of the project into manageable milestones:

### Milestone 1: Static Solar System Display
*   **Goal:** Render the Sun and the planets of our solar system in their approximate positions.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Set up a basic HTML page.
    *   Initialize a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer.
    *   Create spherical geometries for the Sun and each planet (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).
    *   Apply basic materials/colors to each celestial body.
    *   Position the planets around the Sun (no orbits yet, just static placement).
    *   Add a light source (e.g., a point light emanating from the Sun).

### Milestone 2: Dynamic Orbits & Basic Camera Controls
*   **Goal:** Animate the planets orbiting the Sun and allow basic user interaction with the camera.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Implement elliptical orbit paths for each planet.
    *   Animate the planets moving along their respective orbits.
    *   Implement basic camera controls (e.g., zoom in/out, pan the view using mouse or keyboard).
    *   (Optional) Add axial tilt to planets where appropriate.

### Milestone 3: Information Display & Visual Polish
*   **Goal:** Enhance the user experience by providing information about the celestial bodies and improving visual fidelity.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Display planet names (e.g., on hover or as persistent labels).
    *   Show basic information about a planet when it's clicked or hovered over (e.g., diameter, distance from Sun).
    *   Apply more realistic textures to the Sun and planets.
    *   (Optional) Add rings for Saturn.
    *   (Optional) Add a starry background/skybox.
    *   (Optional) Implement more advanced camera controls (e.g., focus on a specific planet).
